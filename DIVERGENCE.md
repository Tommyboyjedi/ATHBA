# Divergence Report: Specification vs. Implementation

This document outlines the differences between the specified requirements in `Specification Document.txt` and the current implementation.

## Core Components Status

### ✅ Implemented

- **Project Structure**
  - Django project with core application structure
  - Poetry for dependency management
  - Settings configuration with environment variables

- **Agent System**
  - Base agent interface (`IAgent`)
  - PM Agent implementation with behaviors as a high-level orchestrator
  - Developer and Tester agent stubs (incomplete IAgent implementation)
  - Resource Director agent with basic functionality
  - Behavior-based agent architecture
  - `SpecBuilderAgent` for handling specification creation and modification

- **Model Management**
  - Model registry with tiered model support
  - Multiple model configurations per agent
  - Dynamic model loading based on agent type
  - Context window and thread configuration

- **Data Storage**
  - MongoDB integration via PyMongo and Motor
  - Repository pattern implementation
  - Session management

- **LLM Integration**
  - LLM server management
  - Model loading and inference
  - Conversation management

### ⚠️ Partially Implemented

- **Memory System**
  - Basic session persistence exists
  - Missing complete implementation of the three-tier memory model
  - Partial MongoDB integration for data storage

- **Agent Communication**
  - Basic message passing implemented
  - Missing complete implementation of the agent coordination patterns
  - Partial implementation of the agent lifecycle

- **User Interface**
  - Basic HTMX frontend with real-time chat updates via SSE is implemented.
  - Chat UI is functional but lacks advanced features (e.g., avatars, rich formatting).
  - Dashboard for project metrics is not yet implemented.
  - Live Spec Panel and editor are not yet implemented.

### ❌ Missing or Incomplete

#### 1. Agent System
- **PM Agent (Divergence)**
  - The `Specification Document.txt` describes the PM agent as a co-author of the project specification. 
  - **Current Implementation**: The PM agent acts as a high-level orchestrator. It routes user requests to other agents based on intent. It no longer directly handles specification authoring, delegating that task to the new `SpecBuilderAgent`.

- **Architect Agent**
  - No implementation found
  - Missing repository analysis and planning functionality

- **Developer/Tester Pairs**
  - Basic stubs exist but lack complete TDD workflow.
  - They do not fully implement the `IAgent` interface (missing `llm_prompt`, `agent_type`, `session` properties).
  - Missing integration with Git operations

#### 2. Memory System (Divergence)
- **Centralized Memory Manager Missing**: The specification describes a `Memory Manager` service that provides structured access to a three-tier memory system. This service has not been implemented. Data access is handled by individual repositories instead.
- **Short-Term Memory**: The in-memory cache backed by a capped MongoDB collection is not implemented.
- **Medium-Term Memory**: This is the most complete tier, with repositories for conversations, agent logs, and spec versions.
- **Long-Term Memory**: A `SnippetRepo` exists for storing code snippets, but it lacks the vector search and similarity matching capabilities required by the specification. It functions as a simple document store.

#### 3. Model Management
- **Model Lifecycle**
  - Basic model loading implemented
  - Missing TTL-based model eviction
  - Limited model fallback mechanisms

#### 4. Resource Management
- **Resource Director**
  - Basic implementation exists
  - Missing advanced resource allocation strategies
  - No concurrency management

- **Project Management**
  - Basic project structure exists
  - Missing project prioritization system
  - Limited resource monitoring

#### 5. GitOps Workflow
- **Repository Management**
  - No Git integration for repository operations
  - Missing branch management
  - No automated testing pipeline

- **Ticket System**
  - Basic ticket repository exists
  - Missing Kanban board implementation
  - No integration with Git branches

## Implementation Details

### Model Registry
- Implements tiered model support (standard/heavy/mega)
- Configurable context windows and thread counts
- Supports different models per agent type
- Environment variable configuration for model paths

### Agent System
- Behavior-based architecture
- Session management for agent state
- Basic message passing between agents
- LLM integration for agent reasoning

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Core Agent Implementation**
   - Finalize Developer/Tester agent implementations
   - Implement Architect agent
   - Enhance agent communication patterns

2. **Enhance Memory System**
   - Implement three-tier memory model
   - Add vector search capabilities
   - Improve session persistence

3. **GitOps Integration**
   - Add Git repository management
   - Implement branch-per-ticket workflow
   - Set up automated testing

4. **User Interface**
   - Implement dashboard for project metrics
   - Create Live Spec Panel and editor

## Notes

- The implementation shows good progress on core architectural components
- Focus should be on completing the agent system and memory management
- GitOps workflow and UI components are major outstanding items
- The model registry is well-implemented but could benefit from additional features like TTL-based eviction
